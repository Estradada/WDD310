          <p>The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is a majestic mountain range located in the northern region of Colombia, South America. It is a unique mountain system that rises sharply from the warm beaches of the Caribbean Sea to extraordinary altitudes, creating impressive ecological diversity in a relatively small geographic space.

            Known for its cultural richness, biodiversity, and unique geographical features, the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is home to diverse indigenous communities, including the Koguis, Arhuacos, Wiwas, and Kankuamos. These communities have maintained their traditional way of life and play a crucial role in the conservation of the region, I live in Bogota but this is a beautiful place in colombia and my favorite</p>
