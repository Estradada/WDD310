        <p>Hey! I am Daniela Estrada, I am from Colombia, I live in Bogotá but I hope to move to Idaho, I am 21 years old, I live with my parents, my brother and my cat. I have been a member of the Church all my life and I love it, I really like animals, especially cats, I have a cat she is 3 yeard old her name is Akira. I like to do workout but I don't really like sports because I was never  good at sports, I like to read books about history and personal growth, although it is something that I enjoy, sometimes I forget to do it, but this year I decided to read more often, I really like to travel, meet new people and other cultures, although I am a little shy, I hope volunteer in another country next. month. It is something that really excites me, it will be a different and new experience. I am new to programming, this is my first year studying, but I hope I can learn a lot and enjoy the process.</p>

          <p>The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is a majestic mountain range located in the northern region of Colombia, South America. It is a unique mountain system that rises sharply from the warm beaches of the Caribbean Sea to extraordinary altitudes, creating impressive ecological diversity in a relatively small geographic space.

            Known for its cultural richness, biodiversity, and unique geographical features, the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is home to diverse indigenous communities, including the Koguis, Arhuacos, Wiwas, and Kankuamos. These communities have maintained their traditional way of life and play a crucial role in the conservation of the region, I live in Bogota but this is a beautiful place in colombia and my favorite</p>
