                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>All of this started with a passion and entrepreneurial fervor, with the desire to bring the adventure and connection with the environment into people's lives. It has been a wonderful project in which we have enjoyed sharing our knowledge and passion with others. Our intention was always clear: to offer rafting experiences that were more than just decent; we aimed for a deep connection with nature and an opportunity for people to discover their own limits. What was just an idea a few years ago has now become the best rafting company, providing top-notch services for all. Our services have been available to you since 2022, stemming from an idea founded in Bogota, Colombia." </p>
